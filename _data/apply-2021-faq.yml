- q1: "The information about the nature and scope of the DH institute we would be offering is a bit vague. Do you have any guidelines about that? We want to make sure we are planning appropriately (especially as regards budget and institutional support) in case someone does get the grant."
  a:  "<p>The nature and scope of the institute is intentionally vague because we have very different types of organizations interested in applying. For example, a small, regional digital humanities organization may not have much financial backing, but there may be someone who has space they want to donate, and someone else willing to donate their time. In the end, there's no budget, but there are people who are willing to help advertise, support, and even work at the institute. However, other institutions might find it easier to give you a budget to work with for food, money to pay an outside trainer, and a computer lab that you can use. For that reason, we've tried to keep the requirements for &quot;how&quot; to do the institutes loose enough that it can be adapted to a variety of organizational types. In the proposal, a letter simply stating that the institution is interested, that it's willing to pay for time, space, and encourage faculty or staff to participate (by giving them the time to do so) would be a good start. If you can do more, that's fantastic. If not... we'll help you try to think through how to work with what you've got.</p>

- q1: "I work in a country outside of the U.S., can I participate?"
  a:  "<p>We are unable to accept applications from individuals outside of the United States and U.S. territories at this time. In order to be accepted into this year's program, you must be able to receive compensation for services rendered in the U.S. To receive the designated stipend, we are required to provide the CUNY Research Foundation with (1) a U.S. social security number or an Individual Taxpayer ID (ITIN), and (2) a routing number and an account number to a U.S. bank. If you are unable to provide this information, we are not able to accept you into the program.</p>
      <p>The materials created to run institutes, <a href=\"/reports/\">our reports</a> and <a href=\"https://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/\">our curricula</a> are available for others to use, which means that you have the ability to run an institute despite not being able to join the program officially.</p>
      <p><em>If you choose to run an institute on your own, <a href=\"mailto:info@dhinstitutes.org\">reach out to us</a>. We would love to hear about it and promote it through our channels as well.</em></p>"

- q1: "The application form asks for a letter of support from the institution as well as a letter from “your direct supervisor stating their agreement and support of your efforts.” In regards to the letter from my direct supervisor, should it just be a brief affirmation that they are aware of and support the application or should it also be a letter of support?"
  a:  "<p>For those applicants who are employed by the sponsoring organization (ie. if you are a librarian and the library you work for is the one that is writing the letter of support), then simply having a letter from your supervisor will suffice. The purpose of the letter is to let us know that your supervisor and your institution are aware of your application and supportive of your efforts. The letter from the supervisor should explain how this work fits within your responsibilities, or how the organization recognizes this work as an important contribution. Though not required, they may also explain that they are willing to provide rooms, time, or similar resources to support your institute.</p>
      <p>The wording for the letter of support is designed to be open-ended to accommodate those applicants who may not be employed by the same organization who is writing to say that they will agree to allow the applicant to run a Digital Humanities Research Institute.</p>"

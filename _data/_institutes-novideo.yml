    text: "Wayne State University Library's DHRI emphasized that digital humanities methods has become increasingly important in scholarly research, classroom teaching, and also provide transferrable technology skills to students in all disciplines. Additionally, cultural heritage professionals can learn how to extend collections and understand the needs of researchers using collections for digital humanities work. Wayne State University's DHRI aimed at supporting this work on campus and in the greater Detroit metro area, and invited all interested to a free, 4-day series of training workshops. The course was taught by WSU Librarians and SIS faculty, and was based on the curriculum developed by the Digital Initiatives at The Graduate Center, CUNY. The DHRI provided basic training in areas of digital humanities computing that humanists interested in digital work are likely to encounter. The course was offered to build a resilient community of DH practitioners who can turn to one another for networking and support, to familiarize participants with basic DH methods they might be hesitant to explore on their own (answering \"where do I start?\" questions), and to empower humanists, librarians, graduate and undergraduate students, and cultural heritage professionals to conduct DH work in southeast Michigan. Participants were challenged and worked hard to build community with others creating digital work, and came away with new knowledge and skills to move their project on to the next step."

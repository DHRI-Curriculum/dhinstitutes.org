    text: "Africana DHi was offered as a three week online workshop between May and June 2019 in association with the Center for Digital Humanities at the University of Arizona. The Africana DHi centered the question: How do we define and implement digital Africana Studies demonstrative of the unique black context for digital usage? Studies in the digital humanities often assume and/or reinforce certain universal frameworks and biases. However, Black cultural practices demonstrate unique epistemologies regarding the digital. Recently, scholars have written extensively on digital hush harbors, Black Twitter, and hashtag activism like #MuteRKelly, #BlackLivesMatter, #SayHerName. During this Institute, participants explored interdisciplinary, digital humanities research and teaching with DH scholars, developed core computational research skills through online workshops, and began developing their own digital humanities projects. When participants completed the workshop, they were invited to share their reflections in a publication of the Spring 2020 Special Issue of <em>Fire!!!</em>, the peer-reviewed digital journal for the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH)."

- q1: "Where can I find the application form?"
  a:  '<p><a href="http://bit.ly/apply-to-dhri" target="_blank">The application form is available here.</a></p>'
- q1: "Who do you envision applying for the DHRI?"
  a: "<p>We have outlined a couple of case studies to help identify the participants that we are looking for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Michael is associate professor of history and associate dean at an HBCU who has been tasked with teaching a methodology-focused graduate-level course. He has previously explored digital methods for creating oral and public histories (particularly Omeka and OHMS), and he collaborated with the library to offer students short, tool-based workshops to record and organize the oral histories with Omeka. Teaching and administrative duties in an interdisciplinary humanities degree program leaves Michael with little time to deepen his technological knowledge of digital humanities methods, which is necessary in order to expand his digital oral history archive project or to integrate digital methods more explicitly into the course syllabus. During the application process, his institution agrees for him to commit time for training and curricular revision. After attending the DHRI, Michael's new understanding of the command line, data, and HTML/CSS help him use Omeka more effectively and advise student projects with confidence. Together with students, Michael begins to build an oral history archive for student civil rights protests and redesigns the introduction to doctoral studies course with DH assignments.</li>
        <li>Arden is Assistant Professor of English at a small midwestern liberal arts college and interested in promoting DH pedagogy and teaching in her department and in her scholarship in ecocritical approaches to medieval poetry. She would like to learn about project development and creating maps. She’d also like to feel more confident answering student questions on DH assignments. At the DHRI, she meets Da who is a digital scholarship librarian at a nearby R1 institution. Da is building a digital humanities center in the library and will use DHRI’s curriculum to develop programming. During the workshop, Da and Arden realize that they could combine their community-building efforts and institutional commitments. Together, they draft funding proposals and win funds from the state humanities council and matching institutional funds to support their DHRI. With those funds, they hire graduate students from a third nearby university to workshops at a shared 5-day regional institute which attracts 20 participants.</li>
        <li>Jean is a tenured professor at a rural community college who wants to work with local historical societies and museums to develop digital mapping and archive projects. After attending DHRI with the support of staff and fellow participants on discussion forums and teleconferences, she gains the confidence and knowledge to teach introduction to the command line, version control with git and GitHub, introduction to Python, and mapping. Twenty curators, local faculty, and archivists participate in Jean’s on-line institute, which she hosts on GitHub, Blackboard, and Slack. With skills that she learns at DHRI combined with new material, Jean’s participants develop shor mapping projects by the end of their 4 week institute, which Jean uses to submit a grant proposal to support their continued collaboration.</li>
      </ul>"
- q1: "Should we submit an application for one person from our institution/working group/lab or should each interested person here apply as an individual and leave it to you all to sort it out?"
  q2: "Can my co-PI/colleague also apply or are you limiting submissions to one participant for each institution?"
  a:  "<p>We are only able to support one representative from 15 different institutions. We have received interest from other applicants who would also like to have a collaborator or partner attend. You may want to ask your institution to see if they would be willing to support this collaborator. If so, they could include in the letter of support that they are interested in sending a second participant whom they will pay a similar stipend separately.</p><p>The institute, however, is designed with only one participant from each institution in mind. As a result, we will spend time during the institute thinking about how to work with collaborators, share responsibilities, and build networks of support both locally and within the cohort of participants. Much of our time will be spent trying to make connections across institutions and forging collaborations and relationships that you can continue to draw from throughout the year.</p>"
- q1: "The information about the nature and scope of the DH institute we would be offering is a bit vague. Do you have any guidelines about that? We want to make sure we are planning appropriately (especially as regards budget and institutional support) in case someone does get the grant."
  a:  "<p>The nature and scope of the institute is intentionally vague because we have very different types of organizations interested in applying. For example, a small, regional digital humanities organization may not have much financial backing, but there may be someone who has space they want to donate, and someone else willing to donate their time. In the end, there's no budget, but there are people who are willing to help advertise, support, and even work at the institute. However, other institutions might find it easier to give you a budget to work with for food, money to pay an outside trainer, and a computer lab that you can use. For that reason, we've tried to keep the requirements for &quot;how&quot; to do the institutes loose enough that it can be adapted to a variety of organizational types. In the proposal, a letter simply stating that the institution is interested, that it's willing to pay for time, space, and encourage faculty or staff to participate (by giving them the time to do so) would be a good start. If you can do more, that's fantastic. If not... we'll help you try to think through how to work with what you've got.</p>"
- q1: "I work in a country outside of the U.S., can I participate?"
  a:  "<p>We are excited to hear how much interest there is from international applicants. International applicants are eligible to apply; however, spaces available to international applicants are limited. Priority will be given to U.S.-based applicants, as the program is designed to create a national network of training institutes. Still, we do not know how many applications we will receive from U.S.-based applicants, and if we receive fewer U.S. applications, more seats for international applicants may be available. We regret that this does not provide you with a definite answer, as predicting the number of total applications is impossible.</p>
      <p>The materials that we create for the institute and the curriculum that we will use will be available for others to use, which means that should your application not be successful, you will still have access to the materials we produce.</p>"
- q1: "The application form asks for a letter of support from the institution as well as a letter from “your direct supervisor stating their agreement and support of your efforts.” In regards to the letter from my direct supervisor, should it just be a brief affirmation that they are aware of and support the application or should it also be a letter of support?"
  a:  "<p>For those applicants who are employed by the sponsoring organization (ie. if you are a librarian and the library you work for is the one that is writing the letter of support), then simply having a letter from your supervisor will suffice. The purpose of the letter is to let us know that your supervisor and your institution are aware of your application and supportive of your efforts. The letter from the supervisor should explain how this work fits within your responsibilities, or how the organization recognizes this work as an important contribution. Though not required, they may also explain that they are willing to provide rooms, time, or similar resources to support your institute.</p>
      <p>The wording for the letter of support is designed to be open-ended to accommodate those applicants who may not be employed by the same organization who is writing to say that they will agree to allow the applicant to run a Digital Humanities Research Institute.</p>"
- q1: "I would like to know if I can send other documents (such as a reference letter) to support my application after I have submitted the online google form application."
  a:  "<p>At this time, we are unable to review materials in addition to those requested as part of your application.</p>"
- q1: "Can I follow along with the work of the Institute in other ways, in case my application is unsuccessful?"
  a:  "<p>Yes, the materials that we create for the institute and the curriculum that we will use will be available on GitHub for others to use, which means that should your application not be successful, you will still have access to the materials we produce.</p>"
- q1: "Will childcare be available?"
  a:  "<p>Unfortunately, we are unable to offer childcare.</p>"

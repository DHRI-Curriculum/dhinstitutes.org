      <p>Originally planned as an in-person workshop, DHRI has redesigned its curricula and pedagogical approach for a hybrid combination of online in-person and self-directed digital skills workshops. DHRI’s 2021 format includes eight, intensive days of foundational digital skill workshops online and the opportunity to connect to a growing network of institute leaders during monthly meetings throughout the academic year. Those interested must apply with a partner or co-applicant who is either located at the same institution or at a nearby or partner institution. Applicants will be accepted in pairs and asked to serve as accountability partners as they learn together.</p>
      <p>During the following academic year, each pair of applicants are expected to lead a local digital humanities institute at their home campus (or campuses). These can be in-person, remote, or hybrid. For more information about the institutes previous DHRI applicants have run, see our <a href="https://www.dhinstitutes.org/network">Network</a> page.</p>

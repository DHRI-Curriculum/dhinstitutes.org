<p>Our DHRI took place over two days in May. We had 15 participants from four institutions that were all local. Part of the project of the DHRI was to do that kind of bridging work. We had a structured morning with workshops and an unstructured, roundtable discussion-based afternoon.</p>
<h6>Pedagogy</h6>
<p>Also, it was important in building the DHRI of my institution to balance out a more structured workshop environment with a playful, experimental, inventive space where participants could engage in lively, speculative conversations about how a tool might be used in their own field. It was based in the fact that for me personally at the DHR I here in New York last year some of the best and most generative moments for me were in those moments at dinners or in breaks. I wanted to create a space for that at my Institute and in the feedback that I received from participants, it was in those in those spaces that some of the most productive work was done as is so often the case in academia more generally.</p>
<h6>Challenges</h6>
<p>I think a major challenge that we faced at our institution was trying to legitimize the work that we were doing there as digital humanities work. Particularly those unstructured conversations, people weren't necessarily sure going in what they were getting out of the Institute. There was an assumption I think that they would—despite my emails—that they would gain some kind of mastery of a tool, which of course isn't possible in a short workshop in one day. So a challenge for me was finding a way to frame what we were doing as productive work. I think that we achieved that through those unstructured discussions, actually. Because it was there that people were doing collaborative, cross-disciplinary work. Which are sort of buzzwords in the digital humanities—collaboration and interdisciplinary—but so much of that happens through conversation and dialogue. I think never underestimate the power of putting people in the same room physically. And also the old adage: if you build it they will come. We have had this dedicated DH space for a while and not much has happened in it, so it was a very important thing for us to hold an event there, to have it be well attended, and to have it as something that we can repeat as a model.</p>
